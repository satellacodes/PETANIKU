# Petaniku Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### ✅ **Encouraged Behavior**

- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

### ❌ **Unacceptable Behavior**

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery**, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Other conduct** which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### 1. **Correction**

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. **Warning**

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. **Temporary Ban**

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. **Permanent Ban**

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting the project team at **conduct@petaniku.id**. All reports will be handled with discretion.

In your report, please include:

- Any additional context
- If there were any witnesses

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - Report received and acknowledged within 24-48 hours
2. **Review** - Investigation of the incident (5-7 business days)
3. **Decision** - Determination of appropriate action
4. **Communication** - Explanation of decision to involved parties
5. **Appeal** - If applicable, appeal process (7 days)

## Community Expectations

### For All Community Members

- **Respect the project's mission** - Our goal is to help farmers and consumers
- **Be patient with newcomers** - Everyone starts somewhere
- **Assume good intentions** - But address impact, not just intent

## Special Considerations for Our Community

Given Petaniku's focus on supporting Indonesian farmers, we have additional expectations:

### Cultural Sensitivity

- **Respect local farming practices** and traditional knowledge
- **Acknowledge regional differences** in agricultural methods
- **Use appropriate language** when discussing farming communities
- **Be mindful of economic realities** faced by small-scale farmers

### Technical Discussions

- **Explain technical terms** when communicating with non-technical contributors
- **Be patient with translation challenges** - Many contributors use English as a second language
- **Provide context** for decisions affecting user experience
